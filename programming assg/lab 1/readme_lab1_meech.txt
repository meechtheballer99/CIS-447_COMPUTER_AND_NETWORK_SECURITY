Files used (only 2):

1) I used exploit.c and made changes. I made comments so you can see what I added for the exploitation. This file can be compiled normally.

2) I used stack.c and changed BUF_SIZE =64 as per the instruction. Make sure to compile this with -g for gdb debugging, and with -z to set executable stack option to true. Finally I used -fno-stack-protector option to turn off segment protections.
